# Project Title: Funniest WiFi Network Names

## Project Overview
This is a web platform for user-submitted WiFi network names—funny, humorous, creative, or whatever users can come up with. Users can vote, rate, comment, and view these names. With this app, users will create personal collections of humorous WiFi names, vote on their favorites, and engage with fellow users through comments. The project serves as a fun and engaging way to explore the principles of backend and frontend development in an innovative and lighthearted context.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Authenticate users to sign up, log in, and manage accounts.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can submit, update, delete, and rate WiFi names.
- **List View**: Display a list of WiFi names with ratings and descriptions, along with comment sections.
- **Search and Filters**: Users can search WiFi names by categories, such as "punny," "sarcastic," or "geeky."
- **User Interaction**: Allow users to rate WiFi names, leave comments, and create personalized lists.
- **User Dashboard**: Each user can view and manage their submitted WiFi names.
- **Responsive Design**: The app will be mobile-friendly and accessible on all devices.
